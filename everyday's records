1201 in 2025
It's a good day.
It's warm outside.
The sunshine is somewhat hot.

CET6 is coming.
But don't worry.
Just be better little by little, to the end.

----
The people in Github are so cute
Some use markdown file
----
----
They share many good things

He share website and learning tools relevant to Japan
https://github.com/NoHeartPen/awesome-japanese-study-tools

This is another one's learning Japanese
https://github.com/sangjiexun/japanese_study_for_programmer


A friend also learns AI in the github.
He loves the spirit of sharing.
That's so good.

The world is so beautiful
But living is hard
When can I have a rest?

Now prepare for CET6
That is a small challenge
Can I do it?
Even though I do it or not do it, it doesn't matter
It can help me get to the end.
I want the end.
No more thinking.
No more worry.
----
----
Soon I can arrive at the ending
I should learn many things and do many things
And they will feel good
Then I finish my life mission
My good friend may be able to know this
And I don't want to do anything more.
I want to rest.
Maybe end the life, if I'm tired of the world
Now I'm also tired, but my mission hasn't been finished
They won't be happy
I want to see the fresh outside world
I want my good friend to know me again
He's just a little boy, but I always forget this point
And being admitted into Tokyo is so hard.
It's enough if I can do it.
Don't want to do anything more.
Can't do more difficult things.
I want to rest.
Don't want think anyone anything anymore
My good friend, I'm so tired.
Bye.

My good friend is older than me only several days
But we keep friendship only 3 years
Two good friends younger than me, but so smart
Two another good friends are also smart, and are kind to me even if I'm wrong.
My one two three four five friends are all smart and cute

But sorry,
I don't want to feel or think anymore

All I need to do is finish my life mission

Being admitted to the world-class Univ. is enough.
Everyone will be happy.
----
----
So miserable to think about these relationship or those things on the eyes
Living is miserable
Having good friends is miserable
His leaving is also miserable
Anything is miserable
Only death can end the thinking
Nothing can be perfect
Lost too many precious things
Only sadness left and no more coming back
Only death can make everything perfect
Only ending the bad life of mine can make the world better
The last thing to do is get admitted into Tokyo Univ.
The sooner the better
You should do more useful things everyday

Achieving the goal signifies so much; finally, everything can come to an end. That's a great relief.
And my good friend will also feel good even if he doesn't want see and hear me anymore.
And I want to end the thinking.
It's endless and restless.
I don't want to think anymore
OK,let's start the loong dream from now
It's a loong dream to arrive at the end
