1201 in 2025
It's a good day.
It's warm outside.
The sunshine is somewhat hot.

CET6 is coming.
But don't worry.
Just be better little by little, to the end.

----
The people in Github are so cute
Some use markdown file
----
----
They share many good things

He share website and learning tools relevant to Japan
https://github.com/NoHeartPen/awesome-japanese-study-tools

This is another one's learning Japanese
https://github.com/sangjiexun/japanese_study_for_programmer


A friend also learns AI in the github.
He loves the spirit of sharing.
That's so good.

The world is so beautiful
But living is hard
When can I have a rest?

Now prepare for CET6
That is a small challenge
Can I do it?
Even though I do it or not do it, it doesn't matter
It can help me get to the end.
I want the end.
No more thinking.
No more worry.
----
----
Soon I can arrive at the ending
I should learn many things and do many things
And they will feel good
Then I finish my life mission
My good friend may be able to know this
And I don't want to do anything more.
I want to rest.
Maybe end the life, if I'm tired of the world
Now I'm also tired, but my mission hasn't been finished
They won't be happy
I want to see the fresh outside world
I want to my good friend know me again
He's just a little boy, but I always forget this point
And being admitted into Tokyo is so hard.
It's enough if I can do it.
Don't want to do anything more.
Can't do more difficult things.
I want to rest.
Don't want think anyone anything anymore
My good friend, I'm so tired.
Bye.
