1201 in 2025
It's a good day.
It's warm outside.
The sunshine is somewhat hot.

CET6 is coming.
But don't worry.
Just be better little by little, to the end.

The people in Github are so cute
Some use markdown file

They share many good things

A friend also learns AI in the github.

The world is so beautiful
But living is hard
When can I have a rest?

Now prepare for CET6
That is a small challenge
Can I do it?
Even though I do it or not do it, it doesn't matter
It can help me get to the end.
I want the end.
No more thinking.
No more worry.
