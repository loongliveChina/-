No.1 Univ. in the Asia

Many talented people there

At least, you need learn English, Japanese well

Then Computer Science, Software Science...

Engineering, Science, Computer science,...

Believe you can do that.

Japan is a good country.

If you don't have money, you'd best go abroad

Go abroad to a place where people are kind.

You don't mind who you are

If you have money, you can go back to live, to feel those good things in normal mood

But I can't feel anymore, living is so hard

I don't want anything good or bad

Ending the life is a good ending

Now try to be admitted to Tokyo Univ.

Maybe experience whv, part-time job,...

In the end be admitted to the world-class Univ.

Make some money for my family

Everyone will feel good

And I'll say goodbye

My good friend, bye-bye.

Good night.

It's a good ending I want 

No more thinking anyone

No more concern who you are

Bye.
